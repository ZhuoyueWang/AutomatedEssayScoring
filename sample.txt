Dear - Local Newspaper I agree thats computers are good for society. Without computers a lot of things couldnï¿½t be done. Computers are sometimes the easy way out. And thats why I love them. Computers almost makes anything possible. Now say if your an elderly person and you cant get up and your bodys really bad. Well all you need is a computer. You can pay your bills online or you can get a job online or even shop online. All you need is a computer. Computers are also good if your lazy. You can just lay in bed all day and go online to work or to the mall and order things all youll have to care about is personal hygenic. Sometimes computers take a lot of stress of you. No more ignorant co-workers or no angry boss everythings a-okay. Computers are also swel because its the eazy way out. But you have to make sure you get a good computer. Not and old one because it can breakdown. Dats one reason why computers arent so good. But as i said computers are very good they might be a little pesky but ones you get the hand of them everything gonna be alright and remember you can do almost anything with a computer.
