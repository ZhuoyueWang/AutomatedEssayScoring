#Automate Essay Scoring System



Automated essay scoring system is the use of specialized computer programs to assign grades
to essays written in an educational setting. It is a method of educational assessment and an
application of natural language processing. Its objective is to classify a large set of textual
entities into a small number of discrete categories, corresponding to the possible gradesâ€”for
example, the numbers 1 to 6. Therefore, it can be considered a problem of statistical
classification based on the grammar check and the possible topic distribution.
